    "Learning Objectives:\n",
    "* Students will learn about a machine learning algorithm of their choice from a list of choices.\n",
    "* Students will gain experience seeking out and developing quality learning resources and examples for independent learning.\n",
    "* Students will devise and execute in-class and homework exercises to facilitate experiential learning for themselves and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of Machine Learning topics that could be done for this assignment, and I could have put together a lesson for one of them here, but I reflected that a valuable objective at this point is to provide space and time for you to exercise your independent learning skills putting together a lesson for yourself (and a demonstration for others).  A Data Scientist will often need to gain knowledge of a new technique independently.  Thus, this assignment will, like other lessons, have three components (summarized here and described in more detail below):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before class: Put together a list of best resources for learning the material (e.g. readings, videos, etc.) of your chosen ML algorithm, summarize the algorithm, and demonstrate its usage.\n",
    "2. In class: Present your summary and usage demonstration briefly (~5 minutes), and provide a ~15 minute exercise to work through together with your breakout group.\n",
    "3. After class: Create additional homework exercises for yourself to be completed before the following class.\n",
