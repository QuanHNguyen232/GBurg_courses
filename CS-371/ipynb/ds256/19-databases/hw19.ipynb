    "[SQL (Structured Query Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), pronounced \"**s**e**q**ue**l**\", refers to a family of similar relational database query languages.  Think of a database as a collection of persistent tables in memory allowing concurrent, distributed access, querying, and modification.  Indeed, you have already had a hint of what it is like to work with databases, as DataFrames, with their concat, append, merge, join, aggregation, and grouping operations, are similar in many ways similar to database tables.  Even the names of DataFrame operations, like inner and outer join, originate from relational database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is it important to learn about database interactions as a Data Scientist?  The simple answer is that databases are the primary source of large structured information in business.  It would be common for Data Scientists to draw their data from database sources.  It is also often more efficient to perform queries on the database side (using some SQL variant) and only create DataFrames with data of interest, as opposed to loading entire massive, complex tables into DataFrames and filtering or processing the data afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), a.k.a. \"Postgres\", is one of the most popular free and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) relational database management systems.  It also happens to be installed in your CoCalc virtual machine.  In this lesson, we will not attempt to teach the contents of a database _course_.  Rather thing of this as a starting point of reference for initial exposure with encouragement and resources for further learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL-type languages, and query languages in general, are far less expressive than general-purpose programming languages.  They are focused on efficient manipulation of tabular data."

Below we create a connection object ```conn```.  One needs to specify a ```dbname``` database name to make a connection.  We can create other databases as well, but our ability to connect depends on there being a database with which to initially connect.  We connect to database \"postgres\" with the specified CoCalc local host.  We next create a cursor object ```cur``` which you can think of as a pointer to a database row when we execute a query.\n",
