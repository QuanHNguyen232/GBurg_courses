    "  * **Note:**  Throughout our readings, there will be terms used without definition.  There is no one text well-suited to students learning Data Science programming without prerequisite knowledge.  The good news: Programmers dive into documentation without context or definitions all the time.  You'll need to cultivate a few skills in this regard: (1) a tolerance for undefined terms, (2) a curiosity to understand unknown terms and look up definitions, and (3) the wisdom to discern what you need to gain from a reference.  You don't need to understand everything you read up front; you'll build your understanding incrementally.\n",
    "  * [00 - Introduction](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/00-Introduction.ipynb) _Note that this textbook and its code are freely downloadable. As a collection of Jupyter notebooks itself, you can modify and interact with it in an unprecendented way.  You do not need to install Python or any of the tools on your own computer, but you may want to experiment with an installation of your own beyond this class using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), the basic [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation, or other means of learning beyond our [CoCalc Jupyter notebook](https://doc.cocalc.com/jupyter.html) environment._\n",

We will work largely within Jupyter notebooks._\n",
    "  * [02 - A Quick Tour of Python Language Syntax](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/02-Basic-Python-Syntax.ipynb)  _This text is geared towards programmers of other languages and frequently will make comparisons.  Ignore these.  The first code cell is example code we have not covered all parts of, but it essentially iterates through integers 0 through 9 putting those values less than variable midpoint (containing integer 5) into list \"lower\" and all others (>= 5) into list upper.  Then these lists are printed. Note the syntax rules for comments, whitespace, and parenthesis with care.  We will not encounter Python 2 in this course._\n",
    "  * [03 - Basic Python Semantics: Variables and Objects](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/03-Semantics-Variables.ipynb) _A variable is a named location for a value.  Each variable in Python refers to the location of an objects, bundles containing what type of value the object contains and the value itself.  So a variable assigned a value of 42 has a reference or pointer to an object that notes the value is an integer and that integer is 42._\n",

Note that the formatting is similar to the natural style of formatting that has evolved in text-only emails.\n",

A good quick reference is [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).  Another way to learn Markdown is to simply double-click a cell that does what you want (e.g. including a hyperlink) and infer the syntax from what you see in the cell's Markdown.  Double-click on this cell to see how it's hyperlink is specified.  You can see that the text of the hyperlink is within square brackets and is _immediately_ followed by a parenthesized web address, i.e. Uniform Resource Locator (URL)."
