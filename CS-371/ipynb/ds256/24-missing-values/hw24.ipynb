    "# Data Cleaning: Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A large proportion of a Data Scientists work is _data cleaning_, that is preparing data so that it is ready for modeling.  This includes dealing with missing data (e.g. someone declines to answer income on a survey), outliers (e.g. an entry in millimeters rather than meters), reducing to a common representation (e.g. accounting for synonyms), and other challenges that require the Data Science to _understand_ the data, and programmatically prepare it for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we focus on the challenge of _missing data_.  Interestingly, there is no simple, agreed-upon recipe for handling missing data.  If one has much good quality data, one might simply drop all rows with missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the data that is missing can also tell a story.  A person declining to answer a survey question can carry important information.  Silence can be informative, so explicitly creating a \"_missing_\" categorical value, or a \"sentinel\" numeric value outside the normal range of values, or a separate feature _flagging_ the prior numeric column as having a missing value, is a way of _embracing_ missing data and letting it remain missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, it is sometimes possible to \"fill in the blanks\".  This is called _imputation_ of missing values, and it must be practiced with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: In our readings, it is suggested that one should impute the mean or median for missing values.  While often practiced, this is considered statistically invalid, as it effectively reduces the variance of the data.   It is better to build a predictor of missing values from the other data.  From the supplemental presentation slides above, you will see that there are even more sophisticated ways that do not bias the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there is no perfect methodology.  This is why understanding the data and understanding your intended modeling is of greatest importance.  The first will guide a common sense approach for whether one should prefer to drop, embrace, or impute missing data.  The second will constrain the prior choices based on the flexibility of the modeling method.  For example, whereas decision-tree-based methods can sometimes handle missing values, neural networks cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we work our way to the end of the course, students will start to create more of their notebooks, as **this will be a key way for you to learn beyond this course**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TO-DO: Before Class\n",

    "While reading Leanne and Justin's [\"Data Cleaning in Python: the Ultimate Guide (2020)\"](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-in-python-the-ultimate-guide-2020-c63b88bf0a0d), create interleaved Markdown and Code cells below that **summarize main points** and **follow the programmatic steps** of the Missing Values portion.  Seek to distill that portion of the tutorial to a concise summary in your own words (as I have, but will not supply here).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier, I've made the tutorial data available at [http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/ds256/data/missing/sberbank.csv](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/ds256/data/missing/sberbank.csv).  The tutorial data is directly from the [Kaggle Sberbank Russian Housing Market Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market), and one can read a [description of the data columns](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/data) there in file ```data_dictionary.txt```.\n"
