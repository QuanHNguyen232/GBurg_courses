To create a new Python conda environment (e.g. "cs371") and then makeit available to jupyter notebooks, execute the following:

conda create --name cs371 pip ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=cs371

At the end, we included two packages ("pip" and "ipykernel") to install, and you can include others.  Often, we find that we want to install others after the fact.  We do so by activating the conda environment, installing (usually via pip) each package while the environment is activated, and then deactivating the environment, e.g.:

conda activate cs371
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
conda deactivate

Other packages you'll likely want:
scikit-learn
seaborn
plotly
catboost (at time of writing not supported for Python 3.11)
