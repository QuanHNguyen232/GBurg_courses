To create a new Python conda environment (e.g. "cs371") and then makeit available to jupyter notebooks, execute the following:

conda create --name cs371 pip ipykernel

Later, you'll likely want to add additional packages, and one can do this (e.g. with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn) with the command:

conda install -n cs371 numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn

To make this environment available to jupyter notebooks:

python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=cs371

To list your created environments:

conda env list

Other packages you'll likely want:
seaborn
plotly
catboost (at time of writing not supported for Python 3.11)

Open VS Code with command "code &".
